# kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native

This is an example mobile app which integrates with ORY Kratos. While this app uses React Native to be
cross-platform, the patterns it implements are applicable to iOS Swift, Android Java SDK.

If this is your first time using React Native, please
[https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup](set up the React Native development environment).

Next, run the web task using:

```shell script
$ npm run web
```

**Please note that starting the iOS or Android simulator may require a significant amount of time, which is
related to the way React Native works and not to this code base itself.**

```shell script
$ expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```
